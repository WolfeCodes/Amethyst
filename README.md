2.Project Overview
This repository contains a full-stack web application built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The project is structured into two main folders:

(1)Frontend
The frontend folder contains all the files related to the React frontend of the application. This includes components, stylesheets, and configuration files. The frontend is responsible for rendering the user interface and interacting with the user.

(2)Backend
The backend folder contains the Spring Boot backend code of the application. This includes the main Java files, resources, and test files. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, data processing, and interacting with the database.

The frontend and backend folders are designed to work together to create a cohesive web application. Changes to the frontend or backend may require corresponding changes in the other to maintain compatibility and functionality.
