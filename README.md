2. About Project
   Our project is called the Donut shopping platform. We developed this platform to establish an e-commerce presence for a traditional brick-and-mortar business, aiming to streamline the shopping process, attract 
   new customers, boost sales, and enhance revenue for the owner. The Donut shopping platform solves the problem of limited market reach and accessibility faced by a traditional brick-and-mortar business.
3. Project Overview
  This repository contains a full-stack web application built with React for the front end and Spring Boot for the back end. The project is structured into two main folders:
  (1)Frontend
     The frontend folder contains all the files related to the React front end of the application. This includes components, stylesheets, and configuration files. The front end is responsible for rendering the user 
     interface and interacting with the user.

  (2)Backend
     The backend folder contains the Spring Boot backend code of the application. This includes the main Java files, resources, and test files. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, data 
     processing, and interacting with the database.

    The frontend and backend folders are designed to work together to create a cohesive web application. Changes to the frontend or backend may require corresponding changes in the other to maintain compatibility and functionality.
